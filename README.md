I forked this from a Gist by a Flutter dev, Farhan Sadik Galib: <https://gist.github.com/4c96a4fb23213c1c23d358c13f95c50b.git>.
It's smart and thorough. I thought it would be a helpful learning tool for me to go through it methodically, adding things in a way that makes sense to me. 
Thanks for your work Farhan.
This document, as thorough as it is, starts with some advanced topics, like class. I think I will merge my Dart-from-Scratch repo with this, so as to start at the begining.
